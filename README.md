heroku-buildpack-unrtf
===========================
Includes the libraries to compile and setup [unrtf]() for use on Heroku

This buildpack is built to be used through [Using Multiple Buildpacks for an App](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app).

Known issues:
============
As the package is built under a temp directory and then moved to /app/vendor, it's config search path points to the temp directory which gets deleted, so it fails to run. It is possible to run it with the -P flag as a workaround for now:

`unrtf -P /app/vendor/unrtf/config/unrtf/`

Usage
=====

Add the following to your .buildpacks/app.json:

`https://github.com/lucasKoeb/heroku-buildpack-unrtf`

Or run the following from the heroku command line:

`heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/lucasKoeb/heroku-buildpack-unrtf`

Unrtf
=====

[unrtf](https://www.gnu.org/software/unrtf/) is a RTF to HTML converter released by the [gnu project](https://www.gnu.org/).
